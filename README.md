# Automated Honeypot Deployment Stack

This project is an automated tool for deploying Honeypots (T-Pot). It combines Python and Ansible to achieve rapid configuration, deployment, and centralized log collection.

## Features
* **Python Tool**: An interactive CLI tool to configure Honeypot parameters dynamically.
* **Ansible**: Automates the deployment process and log aggregation across multiple nodes.
* **Docker**: Manages Honeypot services using containerized environments.

## Directory Structure
* `src/`: Source code for the Python configuration tool (`honeypot_tool.py`).
* `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks for automated deployment and log collection.
